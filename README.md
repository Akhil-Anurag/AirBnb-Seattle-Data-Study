# Projects : Predicting AirBnb listing price and other insights from AirBnb Seattle data

1. Installations

This project was written in Python, using Jupyter Notebook on Google collab. The relevant Python packages for this project are as follows:

a. numpy
b. pandas
c. matplotlib
d. sklearn
e. sklearn.model_selection (train_test_split)
f. sklearn.preprocessing (StandardScaler)
g. sklearn.metrics (R2_Score,mean_squared_error,make_scorer)
h. sklearn.linear_model (LinearRegressor)
i. sklearn.SVM (SVRegressor)
j. sklearn.ensemble (RandomForestRegressor)
k. sklearn.model_selection (RandomizedSearchCV, GridSearchCV)
l. matplotlib.pyplot (plt)
m. seaborn
n. nltk (vader_lexicon, SentimentIntensityAnalyzer)
o. collections(counter)


2. Project Motivation

Seattle AirBnB Dataset contains data about AirBnB listings in Seattle, calendar availability for each of these listings as well as user reviews on the listings. Using this dataset, I am going to attempt to answer the following business questions.

    a. Can we predict listing price using the available information ?
    b. Can we find out the most important drivers to listing price?
    c. Are the factors influencing price also influence reviews?

3. File Descriptions

This repo contains two files, called AirBnb_Seattle_Project.ipynb that contains the code and its html file. The blog post can be found [here](https://medium.com/akhil-anurag/seattle-airbnb-price-predictions-7966f0966940?)

4. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.

Seattle AirBnB data was obtained from Udacity. Other references are cited within the notebook.
